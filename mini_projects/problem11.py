#Level 2

#Question:
#Write a program which accepts a sequence of comma separated 4 digit binary numbers as its input and then check whether they are divisible by 5 or not. The numbers that are divisible by 5 are to be printed in a comma separated sequence.
#Example:
#0100,0011,1010,1001
#Then the output should be:
#1010
#Notes: Assume the data is input by console.

X=(input("Enter 4  digit binary numbers :").split(","))
my_list=[]

for i in X:
    if(int(i,2)%5==0):
        print(i)
        my_list.append(i)
print(my_list)
res=",".join(my_list)
print(res)

# decimal = int(i,2)
# # if not decimal%5:
